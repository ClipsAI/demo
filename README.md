## Introduction
This repo provides a simple video trimming and resizing UI for the clips generated by
Clips AI. Clips AI is an open-source Python library that automatically converts
long videos into clips. Check out the library [here](https://github.com/ClipsAI/clipsai).

> **Note:** The data used in the demo were all generated using the clipsai library.

> **Note:** In the 9:16 format, the transition cuts to different speakers can appear
glitchy. This issue stems from slightly delayed event triggers, which don't always align
with the exact moment of speaker change in the video. However, the timing for resizing
and frame switching provided by our Python library is precise, ensuring accurate cuts
when cropping the video with FFmpeg.
